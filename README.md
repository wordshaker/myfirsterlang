# My First Erlang

This repo has my work for the [Future Learn Functional Programming Erlang Course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-erlang).
It includes ungraded 'articles' and graded assignments and is organised by week.

I used Erlang 19.2 when running these functions.

## [Week 1](https://github.com/wordshaker/myfirsterlang/tree/master/Week1)

#### [Article1](https://github.com/wordshaker/myfirsterlang/tree/master/Week1/Article1) - My First Erlang Program

Includes functions for:
* Squaring a valu
* Trebling a value
* Calculating the size of a hypthenuse of a right angled triangle give the lengths of the two other sides
* The perimeter of a right-angled triangle, given the lengths of the two short sides.
* The area of a right-angled triangle, given the lengths of the two short sides.

#### [Article2](https://github.com/wordshaker/myfirsterlang/tree/master/Week1/Article2) - Erlang data in practice

Involved evaluating Erlang expressions and testing them in the Erlang shell

#### [Article3](https://github.com/wordshaker/myfirsterlang/tree/master/Week1/Article3) - Variables and patterns in practice

Included:
* Giving three ways of defining exclusive or (XOR)
* Giving a definition of the function maxThree which takes three integers and returns the maximum of the three.
* Giving a definition of the function howManyEqual which takes three integers and returns an integer, counting how many of its three arguments are equal.
